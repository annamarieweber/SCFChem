SCFChem is a C++ tool for calculating nuclear energy, force, and other properties of molecules using the Self-\/\+Consistent Field (SCF) method. This package is designed for use in quantum chemistry and computational materials science, and allows users to easily compute and analyze the electronic structure of molecules.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

SCFChem requires the armadillo library to be installed on your system. Armadillo can be downloaded from \href{https://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html}{\texttt{ https\+://arma.\+sourceforge.\+net/download.\+html}}. You should be able to find installation instructions there as well.

If your armadillo header and library files are installed in a location other than {\ttfamily /usr/local/include} and {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib} respectively be sure to set the environment variable {\ttfamily LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS} using one of the methods described below.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Set LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS at the directory level with direnv}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
If you have direnv set up on your system you can set the environment variable by creating a .envrc file and adding the following line to it\+: {\ttfamily LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS=\char`\"{}-\/\+I/path/to/armadillo/headers -\/\+L/path/to/armadillo/libraries\char`\"{}} and then running direnv allow. Alternatively the following line will also complete these steps for you {\ttfamily echo LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS=\char`\"{}-\/\+I/path/to/armadillo/headers -\/\+L/path/to/armadillo/libraries\char`\"{}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Set LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS in your shell profile}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
Add {\ttfamily export LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS=\char`\"{}-\/\+I/path/to/armadillo/headers -\/\+L/path/to/armadillo/libraries\char`\"{}} to the profile file for your shell of choice. For example, if you use zsh add the line to your {\ttfamily $\sim$/.zshrc} file.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Temporarily set LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS in terminal}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
Run {\ttfamily export LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS=\char`\"{}-\/\+I/path/to/armadillo/headers -\/\+L/path/to/armadillo/libraries\char`\"{}} in the terminal prior to running make commands. note that the environment variable will only be set for that session and you will need to re run the command each time you start a new session.

{\ttfamily path/to/armadillo/headers} and {\ttfamily /path/to/armadillo/libraries} should be the parent directories where these items are stored. For example if your armadillo installation has the header files at {\ttfamily /usr/share/include/armadillo} and {\ttfamily /usr/share/include/armadillo\+\_\+bits} and library files at {\ttfamily /usr/share/lib/libarmadillo.dylib} then your {\ttfamily LOCAL\+\_\+\+PATHS} environment variable should be {\ttfamily \char`\"{}-\/\+I/usr/share/include -\/\+L/usr/share/lib\char`\"{}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
To use SCFChem, run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make run mol=molecule}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Where {\ttfamily molecule} is a file ({\ttfamily molecule.\+txt}) in the {\ttfamily molecule\+\_\+files} directory containing the input data for the calculation . The input data should include the atomic coordinates and other necessary information for the calculation. The output will be written to a file in the {\ttfamily output} directory called {\ttfamily molecule.\+out}. Some example molecules are already included in the molecule\+\_\+files directory for convenience.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Docs}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
